        <h1>Welcome to my Week 1 project at HNG</h1>
        <p><a href="https://hng.tech/">HNG</a> internship is proving to be an amazing platform for practical hands-on learning!  
        Right from the start, I've been given the opportunity to tackle the deployment of a static website on an NGINX webserver hosted in a public cloud.
        This fast-paced internship is helping me develop and hone valuable skills in DevOps and I am super excited at what is bound to unfold in subsequent 
        weeks of the program! </p>
